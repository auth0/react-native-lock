# react-native-lock

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![CI Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps and Salesforce.

**react-native-lock** is a wrapper around Lock's implementations for [iOS](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX) and [Android](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.Android) ready to use for React Native

## Requirements

### iOS

* iOS 7+
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

### Android

* Minimum SDK 16

## Installation

Run `npm install --save react-native-lock` to add the package to your app's dependencies.

### iOS

#### react-native cli

Run `react-native link react-native-lock` so your project is linked against your Xcode project & install Lock for iOS using CocoaPods and run `react-native run-ios`

#### Manually

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-lock` and add `A0RNLock.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libA0RNLock.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Click `A0RNLock.xcodeproj` in the project navigator and go the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic'). Look for `Header Search Paths` and make sure it contains `$(SRCROOT)/../react-native/React`, `$(SRCROOT)/../../React`, `${SRCROOT}/../../ios/Pods/Headers/Public` and `${SRCROOT}/../../ios/Pods/Headers/Public/Lock` - all marked as `recursive`.
5. Inside your `ios` directory add a file named `Podfile` with the following [content](https://github.com/auth0/react-native-lock/blob/master/Podfile.template)
6. Run `pod install --project-directory=ios`
7. Run `react-native run-ios`


#### CocoaPods Warning

If you get the following warning.

```
[!] The `<YourAppName> [Debug]` target overrides the `OTHER_LDFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.debug.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.

[!] The `<YourAppName> [Release]` target overrides the `OTHER_LDFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.
```

Click `<YourAppName>.xcodeproj` in the project navigator and go the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic'). Look for `Other Linker Flags` and replace the value `-ObjC` with the value `$(inherited)` for your Application's Target.

#### Compile error react-native >=0.26.0

If you are using a `react-native` version `>=0.26.0`, you might encounter the following error while trying to run the project

```
"std::terminate()", referenced from:
        ___clang_call_terminate in libReact.a(RCTJSCExecutor.o)
```

*React Native* introduced some C++ code so we need to tell **Xcode** to include use those symbols for compile. First click `<YourAppName>.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator to show your project's target (at least one for your app).
Then for each of the targets do the following:

- Go the `Build Settings` tab, and make sure `All` is toggled on (instead of `Basic`)
- Look for `Other Linker Flags` and add the flag `-lc++` for **all** configurations

> If your project was created using `react-native init` command, you will have two targets (app & tests) so make sure **BOTH** of them has the correct flags

#### CocoaPods with uses_framework! flag

> This more of a hack than an actual solution. We recommend to avoid including Lock as a dynamic framework unless you have a very good reason to do that.

After setting up `react-native-lock` either [Manually](#manually) or using [react-native cli](#react-native-cli) you need to open your iOS project with Xcode and follow these steps:

1. Click `A0RNLock.xcodeproj` in the project navigator and go the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic'). Look for `Framework Search Paths` and make sure it contains `$BUILD_DIR/$CONFIGURATION$EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME/Lock`
2. Change to the `A0RNLock.xcodeproj` target tab `Build Phases`, and in the section `Link Binary with Libraries` click the `+` and add `Lock.framework` and make sure it's `Status` is set to **optional**
3. In the project navigator, select your project (should be the top one) and go the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic') and look for `Other Linker Flags` and make sure the value `-ObjC` is listed there

### Android

#### react-native cli

Run `react-native link react-native-lock` so your project is linked against your Android project

In your file `android/app/build.gradle`, inside the `android` section add the following

```gradle
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
    exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
}
```
> This fixes the error `Error: duplicate files during packaging of APK

Then in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` add the following inside `<application>` tag

```xml
<!--Auth0 Lock-->
<activity
  android:name="com.auth0.lock.LockActivity"
  android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme"
  android:screenOrientation="portrait"
  android:launchMode="singleTask">
</activity>
<!--Auth0 Lock End-->
<!--Auth0 Lock Embedded WebView-->
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.identity.web.WebViewActivity"
    android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme">
</activity>
<!--Auth0 Lock Embedded WebView End-->
<!--Auth0 Lock Passwordless-->
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.lock.passwordless.LockPasswordlessActivity"
    android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait"
    android:launchMode="singleTask">
</activity>
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.lock.passwordless.CountryCodeActivity"
    android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme">
</activity>
<!--Auth0 Lock Passwordless End-->
```

And finally run `react-native run-android`

#### Manually

In your file `android/settings.gradle` add the following

```gradle
include ':react-native-lock'
project(':react-native-lock').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-lock/android')
```

In the file `android/app/build.gradle` add a new dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
  //Other gradle dependencies...
  compile project(':react-native-lock')
}
```

And in the same file inside the `android` section

```gradle
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
    exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
}
```

> This fixes the error `Error: duplicate files during packaging of APK

Then in the file `MainApplication.java` add the following Java import

```java
import com.auth0.lock.react.LockReactPackage;
```

> In react-native versions older than 0.29 you should add do this in `MainActivity.java` instead

and add Lock's React Native module

```java
    /**
     * A list of packages used by the app. If the app uses additional views
     * or modules besides the default ones, add more packages here.
     */
    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
            //Other RN modules
            new LockReactPackage()
        );
    }
```

Then in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` add the following inside `<application>` tag

```xml
<!--Auth0 Lock-->
<activity
  android:name="com.auth0.lock.LockActivity"
  android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme"
  android:screenOrientation="portrait"
  android:launchMode="singleTask">
</activity>
<!--Auth0 Lock End-->
<!--Auth0 Lock Embedded WebView-->
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.identity.web.WebViewActivity"
    android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme">
</activity>
<!--Auth0 Lock Embedded WebView End-->
<!--Auth0 Lock Passwordless-->
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.lock.passwordless.LockPasswordlessActivity"
    android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait"
    android:launchMode="singleTask">
</activity>
<activity
    android:name="com.auth0.lock.passwordless.CountryCodeActivity"
    android:theme="@style/Lock.Theme">
</activity>
<!--Auth0 Lock Passwordless End-->
```

> For more information and configuration options you should see the Lock.Android [docs](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.Android)

And finally run `react-native run-android`

## Usage

Let's require `react-native-lock` module:

```js
var Auth0Lock = require('react-native-lock');
```

And initialize it with your Auth0 credentials that you can get from [our dashboard](https://app.auth0.com/#/applications)

```js
var lock = new Auth0Lock({clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", domain: "YOUR_DOMAIN"});
```

### Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication

```js
lock.show({}, (err, profile, token) => {
  console.log('Logged in!');
});
```

And you'll see our native login screen

[![Lock.png](https://cdn.auth0.com/mobile-sdk-lock/lock-ios-default.png)](https://auth0.com)

### Avoid WebView for Social Auth

In order to make Lock use the OS browser to perform Web Auth you will need to pass the attribute `useBrowser` when you build Lock like

```js
var lock = new Auth0Lock({clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", domain: "YOUR_DOMAIN", useBrowser: true});
```

Then you need to configure both your iOS and Android project following the instructions detailed below.

> **IMPORTANT**: This feature only works with iOS 9 or later.

### iOS

In the file `AppDelegate.m` add the following import on the top (next to the other imports of the file)

```objc
#import "A0LockReact.h"
```

and then inside the `AppDelegate` implementation add the following method

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options {
  return [[A0LockReact sharedInstance] handleURL:url sourceApplication:nil];
}
```

And finally in the file `Info.plist` add the following entry

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
    <string>Editor</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>auth0</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>{Bundle Identifier}</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

Where the Bundle identifier can be found in the same file under the key `CFBundleIdentifier` like

```xml
<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
<string>org.reactjs.native.example.$(PRODUCT_NAME:rfc1034identifier)</string>
```

### Android

In the file `AndroidManifest` find where the `LockActivity` is declared and insde the `activity` tags add the following

```xml
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
  <data android:scheme="a0{your lowercase auth0 client id}" android:host="{your auth0 domain}"/>
</intent-filter>
```

And make sure Lock's activity launch mode is `singleTask` 

### TouchID (iOS Only)

```js
lock.show({
  connections: ["touchid"]
}, (err, profile, token) => {
  console.log('Logged in!');
});
```

And you'll see TouchID login screen

[![Lock.png](https://cdn.auth0.com/mobile-sdk-lock/lock-ios-pwdless-touchid.png)](https://auth0.com)

> Because it uses a Database connection, the user can change it's password and authenticate using email/password whenever needed. For example when you change your device.

### SMS Passwordless

```js
lock.show({
  connections: ["sms"]
}, (err, profile, token) => {
  console.log('Logged in!');
});
```
And you'll see SMS Passwordless login screen

[![Lock.png](https://cdn.auth0.com/mobile-sdk-lock/lock-ios-pwdless-sms.png)](https://auth0.com)

### Email Passwordless

```js
lock.show({
  connections: ["email"]
}, (err, profile, token) => {
  console.log('Logged in!');
});
```
And you'll see Email Passwordless login screen

[![Lock.png](https://cdn.auth0.com/mobile-sdk-lock/lock-ios-pwdless-email.png)](https://auth0.com)

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading your `react-native` version just run `react-native upgrade` and overwrite all conflicts (option `a` or `overwrite this and all others`).

> If you have custom code in any of the conflict files, like `AppDelegate.m`, it's probably best to backup a copy to apply those changes later.

Then run `react-native link react-native-lock` and follow the same steps like you did the first time you installed the library.

## API

### Lock

####.show(options, callback)
Show Lock's authentication screen as a modal screen using the connections configured for your applications or the ones specified in the `options` parameter. This is the list of valid options:

* **closable** (`boolean`): If Lock screen can be dismissed
* **disableSignUp** (`boolean`): default to false, if true will hide the signup button
* **disableResetPassword** (`boolean`): default to false, if true will hide the reset password button
* **connections** (`[string]`): List of enabled connections to use for authentication. Must be enabled in your app's dashboard first.
* **authParams** (`object`): Object with the parameters to be sent to the Authentication API, e.g. `scope`.

The callback will have the error if anything went wrong or after a successful authentication, it will yield the user's profile info and tokens.

####.authenticationAPI()
Returns Auth0 Authentication API client that can be used to refresh user's token, obtain user information or call Auth0 delegation.

> For more info check [react-native-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/react-native-auth0)

####.usersAPI(token)
Returns Auth0 Users API client using a valid user's token for [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users). With this client you can update user's metadata or link two user accounts.

> For more info check [react-native-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/react-native-auth0)

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
